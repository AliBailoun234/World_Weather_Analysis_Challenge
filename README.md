# World_Weather_Analysis_Challenge


### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to use the weather description data for beta testers to input statements and filter the data to their weatehr preferences. After inputting statements, beta testers will receive potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the picked list, beta testers will choose four cities and create a travel itinerary. Using Geoapify Routing API, this project creates a travel route between the four cities and a marker layer map.
